# Number-Guessing-Game
It is a simple number guessing game made with html, css and js.
You are given a total of 10 attempts to guess the right number. At every guess, you are given a hint whether you are higher or lower than the actual number. On guessing it right, you get 1 million dollars ðŸ˜†....just kidding!! the game gets over and you have the option to start a new one. The game also ends once your 10 guesses are made and you can start the game once again.
